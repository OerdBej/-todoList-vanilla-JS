# ðŸš€ Todo List

This is a ToDo list that is written only in vanilla JavaScript. This project helped me to understand better how the DOM manipulation works in JavaScript. For this project I have also used LocalStorage in order to save different data form the user. In order to simulate the server in this mini project I have used the JavaScript API provided by the web browser the localStorage in order to access and store the object data.
